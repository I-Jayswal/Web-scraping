# Restaurant Review Web Scraping

This project aims to scrape restaurant reviews from a popular review website and save them into a CSV file for further analysis. 
The web scraping script extracts key information such as restaurant name, reviewer name, review rating, review text, and review date. 
The extracted data is then processed and saved into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
